# Module Python SDK (Non official)

**About Module üìñ‚ú®**

Module is providing endpoints to democratize access to existing data on a free and open blockchain. With Module, data is made available to developers without the hassle of creating custom data pipelines or running a full Ethereum node.

We do this by providing endpoints to data that is normally difficult for the average developer to obtain quickly, such as bulk NFT listings and sales data. We hope to empower builders by maintaining high rate limits on our free plan, so anyone can benefit from our API.

Leave the heavy lifting to us. Ship faster using Module‚Äôs diverse set of endpoints for all things NFT.

# Getting Started
This module requires Python 3 or later. Python 3
```zsh
pip install module-sdk
```

After installing the SDK, import it using the following code
```python
from module_sdk import Module

api_key = 'Your api key' # Module API Key. Not required, however rate limits will apply.

# Create a new instance of the SDK
client = Module(api_key=api_key)
```

# SDK Usage

All methods are exposed through their own classes. 
There are four usable classes as shown below
```python
from module_sdk import Module
client = Module()

client.eth # Ethereum Methods
client.nft # NFT Methods
client.centra # Central Methods
client.metadata # Metadata Methods
```

# Method Documentation
Refer below for information on each classes methods.

- [NFT Methods](./docs/nft.md)
- [ETH Methods](./docs/eth.md)
- [Central Methods](./docs/central.md)
- [Metadata Methods](./docs/metadata.md)


# Examples
Getting azuki collection info
```python
from module_sdk import Module

client = Module()
collectionInfo = client.nft.getCollectionInfo({slug: 'azuki'})
```
Getting azuki contract abi
```python
from module_sdk import Module

client = Module()
abi = client.metadata.getContractABI({contractAddress:'0xed5af388653567af2f388e6224dc7c4b3241c544'})
```
